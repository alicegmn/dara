> Access Store (`/src/store/useAccessStore.ts`)

---

## Authentication

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with Spotify.
- Tokens are securely handled and stored in the application state.
- Automatic redirection after successful login.

---

## Error Handling

- Robust error management for API requests.
- Graceful fallbacks when no search results are found.
- User feedback in case of network or authentication errors.
